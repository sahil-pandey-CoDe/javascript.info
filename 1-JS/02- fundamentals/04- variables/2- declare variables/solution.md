## The variable for our planet

That's simple:

```js
let ourPlanetName = "Earth";
```

Note, we could use a shorter name `planet`, but it might not be obvious what planet it refers to. It's nice to be more verbose. At least until the variable isNotTooLong.

## The name of the current visitor

```js
let currentUserName = "John";
```

Once more, if we are positive that the user is still active, we may shorten that to `userName`.

Writing lengthy variable names is made simple by modern editors. Don't save on them. A name with 3 words in it is fine.

And if your editor does not have proper autocompletion, get [a new one](/code-editors).
