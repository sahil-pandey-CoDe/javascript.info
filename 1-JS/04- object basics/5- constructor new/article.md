# Constructor, operator "new"

- The regular `{...}` syntax allows us to create one object. But often we need to create many similar objects, like multiple users or menu items and so on. That can be done using constructor functions and the `"new"` operator.

## Constructor function

- Constructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:

1. They are named with capital letter first.
2. They should be executed only with `"new"` operator.

For instance:

```js run
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;
}

*!*
let user = new User("Jack");
*/!*

alert(user.name); // Jack
alert(user.isAdmin); // false
```

- When a function is executed with `new`, it does the following steps:

1. A new empty object is created and assigned to `this`.
2. The function body executes. Usually it modifies `this`, adds new properties to it.
3. The value of `this` is returned.

In other words, `new User(...)` does something like:

```js
function User(name) {
*!*
  // this = {};  (implicitly)
*/!*

  // add properties to this
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;

*!*
  // return this;  (implicitly)
*/!*
}
```

So `let user = new User("Jack")` gives the same result as:

```js
let user = {
  name: "Jack",
  isAdmin: false
};
```

```js
// create a function and immediately call it with new
let user = new function() { 
  this.name = "John";
  this.isAdmin = false;

  // ...other code for user creation
  // maybe complex logic and statements
  // local variables etc
};
```

## Constructor mode test: new.target

```smart header="Advanced stuff"
The syntax from this section is rarely used, skip it unless you want to know everything.
```

- Inside a function, we can check whether it was called with `new` or without it, using a special `new.target` property. It is undefined for regular calls and equals the function if called with `new`:

```js run
function User() {
  alert(new.target);
}

// without "new":
*!*
User(); // undefined
*/!*

// with "new":
*!*
new User(); // function User { ... }
*/!*
```

- That can be used inside the function to know whether it was called with `new`, "in constructor mode", or without it, "in regular mode". We can also make both `new` and regular calls to do the same, like this:

```js run
function User(name) {
  if (!new.target) { // if you run me without new
    return new User(name); // ...I will add new for you
  }

  this.name = name;
}

let john = User("John"); // redirects call to new User
alert(john.name); // John
```

## Return from constructors

- Usually, constructors do not have a `return` statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into `this`, and it automatically becomes the result.

But if there is a `return` statement, then the rule is simple:

- If `return` is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of `this`.
- If `return` is called with a primitive, it's ignored.

In other words, `return` with an object returns that object, in all other cases `this` is returned.

For instance, here `return` overrides `this` by returning an object:

```js run
function BigUser() {

  this.name = "John";

  return { name: "Godzilla" };  // <-- returns this object
}

alert( new BigUser().name );  // Godzilla, got that object
```

And here's an example with an empty `return` (or we could place a primitive after it, doesn't matter):

```js run
function SmallUser() {

  this.name = "John";

  return; // <-- returns this
}

alert( new SmallUser().name );  // John
```

## Methods in constructor

- Using constructor functions to create objects gives a great deal of flexibility. The constructor function may have parameters that define how to construct the object, and what to put in it.

Of course, we can add to `this` not only properties, but methods as well.

For instance, `new User(name)` below creates an object with the given `name` and the method `sayHi`:

```js run
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;

  this.sayHi = function() {
    alert( "My name is: " + this.name );
  };
}

*!*
let john = new User("John");

john.sayHi(); // My name is: John
*/!*

/*
john = {
   name: "John",
   sayHi: function() { ... }
}
*/
```
